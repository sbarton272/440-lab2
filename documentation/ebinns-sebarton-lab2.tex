\subsection*{Registry Lookup}

In order to lookup a remote object the client uses their \texttt{LookupRegistry} to lookup an object by name string. The \texttt{LookupRegistry} creates a \texttt{LookupRequest} with the object name. This is sent to the server which looks up the object by name in its registry. If the object exists, a \texttt{RemoteObjectStub} is returned through a \texttt{LookupResponse} else the \texttt{LookupResponse} comes back with an exception.

\subsection*{Remote Method Invocation}

\section{Implementation State}

We completed the basic requirements.

The extras that were not added include a skeleton, compiler and loading class files. We chose not to implement skeletons as we were able to add that the necessary methods within \texttt{RemoteObject}.

In order to add a compiler the design would not need to change. When performing a registry lookup a remote object stub is returned. Currently this remote object stub must be instantiated earlier by the server. With a compiler this would simply be replaced by a call to the compiler during an object lookup.

Finally support for loading class files would require a little more work since another server socket would need to be implemented on the host the .class files. Beyond that the remote object stub would handle a .class request and another type of message could be implemented to handle this communication.

\section{Testing}

Our test in built into \texttt{PartyClient}. It automatically runs when \texttt{PartyClient} is run. The test runs each of the methods in the \texttt{Person} object for both a remote and local implementation. \texttt{Person.samePerson} is run using both remote and local objects as arguments to check that the server-side remote object implementation can handle either object type as an argument.
